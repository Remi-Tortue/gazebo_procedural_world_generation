# gazebo_procedural_world_generation

This python package is dedicate to the creation of random gazebo maps.
The goal is to be able to test detection and navigation algorithms on a variety of maps.

## Install

```bash
cd gazebo_procedural_world_generation
pip install -e .
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:$(pwd)/src/gazebo_procedural_world_generation/models # If you’re using Gazebo Classic
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH:$(pwd)/src/gazebo_procedural_world_generation/models # If you’re using Ignition / Gazebo Sim (Fortress, Garden, Harmonic)
```

## How it works
Examples are available in `/examples`.

Our algorithm work as follows :

- Generate de grid.

- File it with collision spaces.

- Tile those spaces with obstacles.

- Generate a world map by placing obstacles accordingly to the grid.



Visualize the map via :
```bash
gazebo worlds/procedural_world.world 
or
gz sim worlds/procedural_world.world 

```
